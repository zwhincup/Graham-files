# Graham-files
# DetectNodesLab: Graham jobscript to call DetectNodes and detect cyclone candidates over the Lab Sea, for ERA5. CGRF has its own jobscript since I had to do it later and it has different paths/variable names, and the Nordic Seas also has its own because there were different lat/lon specifications.
# DetectNodesLab-parallel: Same thing but runs it in parallel for all specified years.
# StitchNodesLab: Graham jobscript to call StitchNodes and have it produce tracks from the DetectNodesOutput. Similarly, Nordic Seas and CGRF have their own jobscripts.
# StitchNodesLab-parallel: Same as above but runs it in parallel for all specified years.
